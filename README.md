# Mining Game
Basic name, yeah. But it is literally what the game is, a mining game!

## Getting Started
This game has no end goal - you stop when you either get bored or max out all the items and rebirth a seemingly infinite amount of times.

To get started, get within a 1-block radius of any block by using the W/A/S/D or arrow keys.

Once you are next to a block, you may mine it. In this game, you may only mine directly parallel or perpendicular to your location - no diagonals. To mine a block, either click on it or press and hold on the block.

## Inventory
To access the inventory, press the 'e' keybind or press the "Inventory" button in the sidebar. To sell all of an item, press the "$" sign that is to the top left of the item. This will earn you coins that you may spend for a rebirth.

## Shop
To access the shop, press the 'r' keybind or press the "Shop" button in the sidebar. The shop modal allows you to view the requirements to purchase better tools. The "Cannot Afford" label will automatically turn green once you have sufficient materials.

## Rebirths
Once you have acquired a sufficient amount of coins by seling items, you may rebirth. Once you rebirth, you will have an increased multiplier for your block damage and your block yield.
